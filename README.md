# DroidSpeech
Android library for continuous speech recognition with localizations.

<b>Supports from Android SDK version 16 and above</b>.

<b><h1>About</h1></b>
Google's default speech recognition library doesn't allow to continuously listen to users voice and a manual stop and start mechanism is involved to use the speech recognition again. This proved to be a downfall for third party developers to optimise the user experience of having continuous speech recognition after each speech result. Adding to this the speech recognition server throws up an error when called upon frequently thus preventing an error free experience to the end user. 

<b>Droid Speech</b> aims to close this gap and provide unparalleled optimisation of continuous speech recognition without any of the above said issues. It is developed keeping in mind all the loopholes which needs to be blocked to have the speech recognition run seamlessly in an android device.
